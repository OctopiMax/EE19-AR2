    <p>So no one told you life was gonna be this way <br>
        Your job's a joke, you're broke <br>
        Your love life's DOA <br>
        It's like you're always stuck in second gear <br>
        When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month <br>
        Or even your year, but <br>
        I'll be there for you <br>
        (When the rain starts to pour) <br>
        I'll be there for you <br>
        (Like I've been there before) <br>
        I'll be there for you <br>
        ('Cause you're there for me too) <br>
        You're still in bed at ten <br>
        And work began at eight <br>
        You've burned your breakfast <br>
        So far, things are going great <br>
        Your mother warned you there'd be days like these <br>
        But she didn't tell you when the world has brought <br>
        You down to your knees that <br>
        I'll be there for you <br>
        (When the rain starts to pour) <br>
        I'll be there for you <br>
        (Like I've been there before) <br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        ('Cause you're there for me too)<br>
        No one could ever know me<br>
        No one could ever see me<br>
        Seems you're the only one who knows<br>
        What it's like to be me<br>
        Someone to face the day with<br>
        Make it through all the rest with<br>
        Someone I'll always laugh with<br>
        Even at my worst, I'm best with you, yeah<br>
        It's like you're always stuck in second gear<br>
        When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month<br>
        Or even your year<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        (When the rain starts to pour)<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        (Like I've been there before)<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        ('Cause you're there for me too)<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        I'll be there for you<br>
        ('Cause you're there for me too)</p>
