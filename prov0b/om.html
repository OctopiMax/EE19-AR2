    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>The Rembrandts are an American pop rock duo, formed by Danny Wilde and
        Phil Solem in 1989.[1] <br> They had previously worked together as members 
        of Great Buildings in 1981. <br> The Rembrandts are best known for the song 
        "I'll Be There for You", which was used as the main theme song for the 
        NBC sitcom Friends.[2]</p> 
    
        <p>Wilde was a member of 1970s cult recording act The Quick,[1]<br> and had released several mildly successful solo albums in the 1980s.<br> Wilde and Solem had been in the power-pop quartet Great Buildings, a band that released one album for CBS in 1981 before dissolving.[1]</p>

        <p>After establishing themselves as The Rembrandts in 1989, Solem and Wilde recorded a self-titled album largely in Wilde's home studio.<br> From this album, the group had their first success during 1990 with "Just the Way It Is, Baby",<br> which scored at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100.[1] The self-titled album scored number 88 on the Billboard 200.[1]</p>

        <p>The next album Untitled, of 1992,[1]<br> featured the minor successes "Johnny, Have You Seen Her?" and "Chase the Clouds Away". Another track from the album,<br> "Rollin' Down the Hill", was used in the film Dumb and Dumber.</p>

        <p>"I'll Be There for You," the theme for the sitcom Friends, reached No. 1 on the Hot 100 Airplay chart for several weeks before being released as a single and peaking at No. 17 on the U.S.<br> Billboard chart.[1] The single has been released in other countries, including the UK, where it reached No. 3 in 1995 and No. 5 in 1997.<br>[1] The success of Friends has caused a greater awareness of the band, and led to greater sales of their recorded albums.<br> The song was also featured on the Friends Soundtrack album. An earlier,<br> previously unreleased version of "I'll Be There for You" with different lyrics was included on their Unreleased Stuff album.</p>

        <p>
            In 2005, the band released an album of re-recorded favorites called Choice Picks.<br> There are two versions of Choice Picks, one released through Awarestore.com which features the new track "Chasin' Down a Rainbow".<br>  The other version was released on the Fuel 2000 label, with the new track "Don't Give Me Up".<br>
